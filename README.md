This is the repository for the Firefox addon [NASA Images](https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/nasa-images/).

Watch some of the most recent NASA images.

You have two buttons with the options of the image you can choose:

<ul>
    <li><b>Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)</b> (default): It is simple, it gets the image or video of the day and shows it.</li>
    <li><b>Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC)</b>: This one shows the most recent image of the Earth taken from the space.</li>
</ul>
